# Pet Project 2

[README in Russian](https://github.com/1mrasts/Payday-App/blob/main/README_RU.md)

## PayDay-site
This repository documents the development process and ongoing updates of the PayDay web application.

The project was originally built for personal use, as many existing alternatives felt inconvenient or poorly designed.
Additionally, it represents one of the fully completed pet projects that will be included in my portfolio and resume.

## Technologies Used

### React and Vite

React and Vite are used as the core technologies for developing a multi-page and feature-rich web application with a clean architecture and high performance.
React serves as the foundation of the project. The entire functionality was implemented using React while keeping the codebase clean and well-structured, avoiding unnecessary complexity and “spaghetti code”.

## Features

### Setting Workdays

A workday can be marked by simply clicking on a specific date in the calendar. This allows quick selection of all working days.

Using the available settings, you can define the hourly wage as well as the start and end time of the workday. Based on this data, the application automatically calculates the total earnings and displays the summarized information in a separate block.

### Additional Settings

The settings mentioned above apply to the current and upcoming days (without affecting already assigned workdays). You can update the hourly rate globally for future days or set a custom hourly rate for a specific day, separate from others.  

The same flexibility applies to working hours — you can define default start and end times or configure them individually for selected days.

### Selecting a Specific Day

To select a specific day (for viewing its details or modifying its data and the settings for subsequent days), double-click on the desired date using the left mouse button.

### Work Schedule Templates

In a separate tab (*), you can configure work schedule templates. Several schedule types are available (e.g., 2/2, 3/3, 5/2).

Before applying a template, you need to specify the starting date from which the schedule pattern will be generated and applied.
